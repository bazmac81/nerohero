          <h2>NOMINATE SOMEONE SPECIAL AND THEY COULD WIN LIMITLESS COFFEE FOR A YEAR</h2>
          <p>
            Over the last year, we’ve all had our share of trials and tribulations. As a nation, we’ve all pitched in, given a helping hand, and pulled together to come back stronger.
            We’re now looking forward to promising and exciting times ahead, but before we put the last year behind us, we’d like to pay tribute, to acknowledge and celebrate individuals that have made a difference. We’re calling them #NeroHeroes.
            We’ll be hand-picking five #NeroHeroes nominees, and as a thank you they’ll be presented an unlimited coffee pass for a year.  
          </p>
          <h2>DO YOU KNOW A NERO HERO?</h2>
          <p>
            We're asking you to call out an unsung hero – somebody who supported you during a tough time, or somebody who encouraged you and kept you smiling. 
            They could be someone that helped you with everyday tasks so you could shield safely, or perhaps you know a volunteer that's helped at a testing centre? It could even be your local shopkeeper, a teacher, or delivery driver.   
          </p>
          <h2>HOW DO I NOMINATE MY HERO?</h2>
          <p>
            Simply click the link below and tell us about your local hero in no more than 300 words. After entries close at midnight on the 23rd May, we’ll review each and every nominee, and hand-pick five #NeroHeroes to win the prize. Best of luck!
          </p>
          <p>
            Entries close 23:59 23/05/2021. T&C’s Apply. UK & ROI only.

Entrants are not permitted to enter using anonymous email services such as, but not limited to, GuerillaMail, Dispostable or Mailinator.</li>
            <li>Should an act, omission, event or circumstance occur which is beyond the reasonable control of the Promoter and which prevents the Promoter from complying with these Terms & Conditions the Promoter will not be liable for any failure to perform or delay in performing its obligations.</li>
            <li>The Promoter may refuse to award a Prize in the event of any entrant’s fraud, dishonesty, breach or non-entitlement under these Terms & Conditions or seek recovery of its value if the Prizes have been awarded.</li>

            <li>If any provisions of these Terms & Conditions are judged to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, this will not affect or impact the continuation in full force and effect the remainder of the provisions.</li>

            <li>In the event of a discrepancy between these Terms & Conditions and the details in any promotional material, the details in the Terms & Conditions will prevail.</li>
            <li>These Terms & Conditions are governed by English law and their interpretation and application will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.</li>
