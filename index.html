          <h2>Who is your community Hero?</h2>
          <p>Nominate your hero for the great things they'd done for your community and we'll award them with coffee on us for a full year, helping you to say thank you for everything they've done and continue to do.</p>
          <h2>What is a Nero Hero?</h2>
          <p>We believe that it's important to make a positive difference to the people you come into contact with each and every day. Our baristas have been doing this over the years in their communities. It can be from the smallest of gestures to the biggest of acts of kindess, regardless it all comes from the heart and a place of caring for others.</p>
          <p> We're asking our customers who their hero has been through the last year and to tell us what it is that they've been doing in helping their community. Maybe it's someone that has been doing your shopping so you can sheild safely, or a volunteer that's helped at a testing centre. Perhaps you know a teacher that has kept all of their children engaged in their classes through these tough times or postman that has simply continued to deliver your amazon parcels - rain or shine.</p>
          <h2>How do I nominate my Hero?</h2>
          <p>Simply tell us about your local hero and what it is they have done that has made sucha  positive impact in your life over these last 12 months. We'll look at each and every nomination and pick the 5 that we feel most reflect the values that we hold dear at Caffe Nero.</p>
