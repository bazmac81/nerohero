          <h2>NOMINATE SOMEONE SPECIAL AND THEY COULD WIN LIMITLESS COFFEE</h2>
          <p>
            As we all look forward to getting back to how things should be, we’d like to pay tribute, to acknowledge and celebrate people who have shown an unwavering kindness and generosity towards others, and made a difference to their day/week/life. We know they’re out there, we need your help in finding them. We’re calling them our Nero Heroes. We’ll be carefully selecting five nominees, all of which will be presented with an unlimited coffee pass for a year as our way of saying thank you.  
          </p>
          <h2>WHO IS YOUR HERO?</h2>
          <p>
            Tell us their story, why are they your hero? Is it somebody who supported you during a tough time, or somebody who encouraged you and kept you smiling? Perhaps they helped with everyday tasks so you could shield safely, or maybe you know a volunteer that's helped at a testing centre? It could even be your local shopkeeper, a teacher, or delivery driver. Anyone you feel has gone above and beyond and deserves to be recognised.   
          </p>
          <h2>HOW DO I NOMINATE MY HERO?</h2>
          <p>
            Click the link below and tell us about your local hero in no more than 300 words. After entries close at midnight on the 30th May, we’ll review each and every nominee, and hand-pick five #NeroHeroes to win the prize. Best of luck!

Entrants are not permitted to enter using anonymous email services such as, but not limited to, GuerillaMail, Dispostable or Mailinator.</li>

            <li>If any provisions of these Terms & Conditions are judged to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, this will not affect or impact the continuation in full force and effect the remainder of the provisions.</li>
            <li>By entering this Promotion, you will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by these Terms & Conditions.</li>
            <li>In the event of a discrepancy between these Terms & Conditions and the details in any promotional material, the details in the Terms & Conditions will prevail.</li>
